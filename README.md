## A deep learning model to detect 37 breeds

To create this AI detector I finetuned a [Resnet34](https://towardsdatascience.com/understanding-and-visualizing-resnets-442284831be8) on the [Oxford-IIIT Pet Dataset](https://www.robots.ox.ac.uk/~vgg/data/pets/?utm_source=newsletter&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=juless_december_newsletter&utm_term=2022-01-09) to detect 37 diffrent breeds of cats and dogs with more than 99% of accuracy. 


To use this model download the **model.pkl** file in the releases.

To run and modify the model by yourself, use the jupyter notebook file **DetectorBuilder.!ipynb**
